Restaurant Manager App

A modern web application that helps restaurants streamline daily operations—from dynamic menu management to sales tracking and seasonal insights. Built with a responsive React + Tailwind CSS frontend and a Python backend, it offers an intuitive interface for staff and robust analytics for managers.

✨ Highlights

Unified dashboard for at-a-glance KPIs: revenue, orders, average ticket size, best-sellers, and profit.
Menu management with create/update/delete for items, categories, and price variants.
Season-aware analytics: visualize sales, profits, and top items across seasons (e.g., Summer, Monsoon, Winter).
Flexible pricing & availability: schedule price changes, mark items as out-of-stock, and manage daily specials.
Responsive UI optimized for tablets used on the floor or at the counter.



🏗️ Architecture

Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS for a fast, component-driven UI.
Backend: Python(Flask) exposing RESTful endpoints.
Database: SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite) depending on deployment.
Analytics: Python data stack (e.g., Pandas + Matplotlib) for charts.
